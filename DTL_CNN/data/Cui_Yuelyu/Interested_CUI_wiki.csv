During apnea, there is no movement of the muscles of inhalation,[citation needed] and the volume of the lungs initially remains unchanged. Depending on how blocked the airways are (patency), there may or may not be a flow of gas between the lungs and the environment. If there is sufficient flow, gas exchange within the lungs and cellular respiration would not be severely affected. Voluntarily doing this is called holding one's breath. Apnea may first be diagnosed in childhood, and it is recommended to consult an ENT specialist, allergist or sleep physician to discuss symptoms when noticed; malformation and/or malfunctioning of the upper airways may be observed by an orthodontist.",No Apnea

1,C0036572,Seizure,"WHAT: Seizure.	Seizure: a paroxysmal transient disturbance of brain function that may be manifested as episodic impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor phenomena, psychic or sensory disturbance or perturbation of the autonomic brain electrical activity.	WHY:	Seizures may occur in systemic lupus erythematosus or in necrotizing vasculitides such as polyarteritis, eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis, aortic arch arteritis, or rheumatoid arteritis.	HOW:	A seizure probably exists when there are generalized convulsions or focal motor/sensory phenomenon. GENERALIZED CONVULSIONS may be preceded by an aura but usually have a sudden loss of consciousness with generalized muscle rigidity then generalized muscle activity. They may have incontinence of urine or feces or laceration of the tongue or buccal mucosa. This usually is followed by flaccidity, drowsiness, or complaints of a headache or sore muscles. FOCAL MOTOR/SENSORY PHENOMENON may precede generalized convulsions but may be tonic or clonic muscle activity that is limited to one extremity, one side of the body, or one side of the face or lateralized/localized sensory sensations. These may only be brief sudden involuntary muscle contractions associated with transitory loss of muscle tone and a brief loss of contact with the environment, repetitive automatic behavior patterns, feelings of familiarity or unfamiliarity associated with compulsive thinking, unpleasant epi- gastric sensations that may radiate to the head, or hallucinations of an auditory, vertiginous, olfactory, gustatory, or visual type.

Clinical manifestations include abnormal motor, sensory and psychic phenomena. Recurrent seizures are usually referred to as EPILEPSY or ""seizure disorder."" <p>Seizures are symptoms of a brain problem. They happen because of sudden, abnormal electrical activity in the brain. When people think of seizures, they often think of convulsions in which a person's body shakes rapidly and uncontrollably. Not all seizures cause convulsions. There are many types of seizures and some have mild symptoms. Seizures fall into two main groups. Focal seizures, also called partial seizures, happen in just one part of the brain.
